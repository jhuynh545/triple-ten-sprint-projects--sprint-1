# triple-ten-sprint-projects--sprint-1

This project focuses on analyzing data from the entertainment industry, specifically investigating TV shows from the "Golden Age" of television, which began in 1999 with The Sopranos. The objective is to study the relationship between the number of IMDb user votes a show receives and its ratings, with the hypothesis that highly-rated TV shows from this era also garner the most votes. The analysis excludes movies to maintain a focus on television shows.
